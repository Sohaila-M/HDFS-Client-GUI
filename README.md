- **Upload Files**: Upload a file from the local file system to HDFS.
- **Download Files**: Download a file from HDFS to the local system.
- **Append to a File**: Append content from a local file to an existing file in HDFS.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter**: For building the GUI.
